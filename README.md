## Description
User analysis is the process by which we track how users engage and interact with our digital product (software or mobile application) in an attempt to derive business insights for marketing, product & development teams. \
These insights are then used by teams across the business to launch a new marketing campaign, decide on features to build for an app, track the success of the app by measuring user engagement and improve the experience altogether while helping the business grow. \
You are working with the product team of Instagram and the product manager has asked you to provide insights on the questions asked by the management team. \
In This Project I've created a Dataset with similar attributes to that of *Instagram* and performed Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL.

## About Dataset 
This Dataset consist of multiple table which represent different feature similar to that of *Instagram* such as, Users, Photos, Comments, Likes and others. \
